# 💡 What is this repo?
This is a hybrid RAG application designed to enhance text generation by integrating powerful retrieval mechanisms. By combining Microsoft's 
GraphRAG and traditional RAG techniques, we acheive state-of-the-art results. We also provide a webUI based on ChainLit for seamless integration, 
extensibility, and ease of deployment.
